FF6 PC (Steam) save editor

## Usage

Things are pretty rough at the moment:

1. Open the web application: https://www.thomasmichaelwallace.com/lockepick/
1. On the top bar use the 'Choose file' button to load your FF6 save file (probably at: `C:/Program Files (x86)/steam/userdata/{userid}/382900/local`)
1. Using the JSON editor make the changes you want to the file.
1. One finished, use the 'Save file' button to download your altered save file.
1. **Make a backup of your original file before replacing it with the altered version!** (nothing is perfect, and this approach definately isn't!)

At the moment there is no validation, so it is up to you to alter the options in a sensible way. If you're looking for some guidance, check out this [save file documentation.](https://www.ff6hacking.com/wiki/doku.php?id=ff6a:doc:savefile)
